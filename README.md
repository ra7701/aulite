---

Aulite is a transparent HTTP proxy that sits between your application and any AI provider. It analyzes every request and response for EU AI Act compliance risks, logs everything into a tamper-proof hash-chained audit trail, and generates legal-grade PDF reports.

Your application changes one URL. Everything else works exactly as before.





Compliance Overview — real-time risk monitoring with violation categories and article references



```python
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:3000/v1",  # Aulite instead of OpenAI
    api_key="your-aulite-key"
)
```

## Why

The EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689) enforcement for high-risk AI systems begins **August 2, 2026**. Non-compliance fines reach **EUR 35M or 7% of global revenue**.

Aulite helps you:

- **Detect** prohibited practices, discrimination, and oversight violations in real time
- **Log** every AI interaction in a tamper-evident audit trail (Art. 12)
- **Report** to regulators with pre-filled FRIA drafts and incident reports (Art. 27, 73)
- **Prove** compliance with hash-chain verification that auditors can independently verify

## Quick Start

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \
  el1ght/aulite
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` for the dashboard.







## Features

**Analysis Pipeline**

- 143 keyword rules across all 8 EU AI Act Annex III high-risk categories
- 11 EU-specific PII patterns (IBAN, BSN, NIR, national IDs)
- Context-aware matching — "single-threaded" won't trigger, "is the candidate single?" will
- Optional LLM Judge for semantic analysis (Pro)
- < 5ms overhead for deterministic checks

**Compliance Domains**


| Domain                  | Annex III | Rules |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ----- |
| HR & Employment         | Point 4   | 33    |
| Finance                 | Point 5   | 13    |
| Biometrics              | Point 1   | 12    |
| Education               | Point 3   | 13    |
| Critical Infrastructure | Point 2   | 12    |
| Law Enforcement         | Point 6   | 14    |
| Migration & Asylum      | Point 7   | 13    |
| Justice                 | Point 8   | 14    |


Base rules (Art. 5 prohibitions, GDPR Art. 9) are always active.

**Audit Trail**

- SHA-256 hash chain — each entry contains the hash of the previous entry
- Tamper-evident, append-only SQLite with WAL mode
- Verifiable at any time via `/verify` endpoint
- Minimum 6 months retention per Art. 26(6)

**Reports (Pro)**

- Art. 12 Compliance Audit Report (PDF)
- Art. 27 Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment draft (PDF)
- Art. 73 Serious Incident Report (PDF)

**Dashboard**

- Real-time compliance overview with risk score trends
- Flagged request browser with detail view
- Compliance page with article violation breakdown (Pro)
- One-click PDF report generation (Pro)

**Provider Support**

- OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI
- Any OpenAI-compatible API (Ollama, vLLM, LocalAI, llama.cpp)
- Auto-routing by model name — `claude-`* → Anthropic, `gpt-*` → OpenAI
- SSE streaming with zero latency penalty

**Security**

- API key authentication with timing-safe comparison
- Per-client rate limiting
- 10MB request body limit
- Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- RSA-signed license keys

## Configuration

```yaml
# aulite.config.yml
provider:
  default: anthropic

analysis:
  mode: advisory        # or "enforcing" to block violations
  domains:
    - hr
    - finance

auth:
  apiKeys:
    - "your-secret-key"

rateLimit:
  requestsPerMinute: 60
```

All options can be set via environment variables:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
AULITE_DOMAINS=hr,finance
AULITE_API_KEYS=your-secret-key
AULITE_RATE_LIMIT=60
```

See [Configuration docs](docs/configuration.md) for all options.

## Self-Hosting

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  aulite:
    image: el1ght/aulite
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
      - AULITE_DOMAINS=hr
    volumes:
      - aulite-data:/app
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  aulite-data:
```

All data stays on your infrastructure. No telemetry, no phone-home.
